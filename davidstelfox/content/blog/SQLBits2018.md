I was lucky enough to go to SQL Bits this year, here are some reflections.

## Pre-Con: Wednesday
The first pre-con day I went to was the Azure SQL Data Warehouse session with James Rowland-Jones, Simon Wheatley and Terry .... The day was split between an overview of Azure SQL Data Warehouse with detailed technical explanations of how it worked from a data engineering perspective. Working with MPP tools like this is where I want my career to go.

## Pre-Con: Thursday
I started in the SSIS At Scale session, which really wasn't for me so I ended up switching to the PowerShell for DBAs session run by Rob Sewell and .... This was definitely the right choice as they ran through dbatool.io, Pester and dbachecks.io. While not a DBA so much of what they discussed is relevant and useful as a Developer. Took loads away and looking forward to trying out some of the tools these discussed.

## Friday
This was the first (and only day) of sessions I went to. I really enjoyed Alex Yates' and ... session comparing Containers in Dockers with Cloning using Redgates SQL Clone, and Bob ... session on SQL Server on Linux was almost certainly the best session I went to during the day. The others were a bit dull - either too broad or nothing more than you could get from a Microsoft video on Channel 9.

## Saturday
I didn't go on the Saturday for a variety of reasons including train works so I went to see Black Panther instead.

The thing that surprised me most was the enthusiasm the conference gave me. It is easy to forget about the shear breadth of things out there when you are working day to day but hearing people talking about the leading edge of data technologies gives me drive to want to work with these things. It is easy to fall into a niche, especially with Microsoft BI, but it would be good to explore what else is out there.
