Reading is something I love, mainly science fiction. I really like [this list]() so in that vein I thought I would start my own to kind of record what I have read (think of it as a form of quantified self) and to keep a note of what I want to read in the future. I tend to find an author I like and then read their canon so will organise this list by authors rather than by year. 

If books are missing from a series (for example, there is only one book from the Culture series in this list I have probably read the rest).
